# tap-gong

`tap-gong` is a Singer tap for [Gong.io](https://gong.io).
It is built with the Meltano [SDK](https://gitlab.com/meltano/sdk) for Singer Taps.

## Configuration

### Accepted Config Options

The Gong tap accepts the following configuration options:

- `access_key`(required): An API access key generated in Gong.
- `access_key_secret`(required): The secret for the access key.
- `start_date`(required): The beginning date from which to start searching calls. Default is python min date.
- `end_date`(required): The end date for searching calls. Default is current date.

### ** NOTE ** ###

`start_date` and `end_date` are required and used in filter clause to make gong API calls. As of today, different API endpoints
have different requirements for filter dates. For example,

**Calls endpoints:** for calls endpoints, filter dates are optional and uses date-time format 
(e.g., '2018-02-18T02:30:00-07:00' or '2018-02-18T08:00:00Z', where Z stands for UTC). 

**Stats endpoints:** for stats endpoints filter dates are mandatory and accepts date format (YYYY-MM-DD). 
`start_date` must be less than `end_date` and `end_date` cannot be greater than current date for stats endpoints.
`tap-gong` uses python min date for `start_date` and current date for `end_date` if filter dates are not provided.
It also adjusts `start_date` by reducing one day if same date is provided for `start_date` and `end_date`.

Please refer to the [Gong API documentation](https://app.gong.io/settings/api/documentation) for more details.
